Description: 
This Python code is a simple GIS automation script that counts feature classes based on their geometry type—Point, Polyline, and Polygon within a specified geodatabase.
It is used in ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro where ArcPy is available.  applied for data management, quality control, database auditing, and project documentation to understand the spatial datasets without any delay. 


Count layer's Output example:
Point: 5  
Polyline: 12  
Polygon: 8


Count Feature Class Output example:
Total number of feature classes: 39
Feature classes:
DHA_KIS_BHA_001_009_RS_PG
DHA_KIS_BHA_001_001_RS_LG
DHA_KIS_BHA_001_001_RS_MG
DHA_KIS_BHA_001_001_RS_NG


Count Layer according to trair name, Output example:
Feature classes ending with _PG: 9
Feature classes ending with _MG: 9
Feature classes ending with _NG: 9
Feature classes ending with _SG: 3
Feature classes ending with _LG: 9
